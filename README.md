### a good password generator written in golang with a restful endpoint

the internet is a scary place; don't use bad passwords

### dictionary

in order to generate passwords that people can actually remember, we need a dictionary, or a list, of like, real words. use whatever you'd like, just know that it has to be a newline delimited list, and we recommend putting in /src/slurp/config as a .pw file, so it's kept out of version control. if this list is long enough, this really doesn't matter, but better to make it super annoying for hackers, right?


### illustration - xkcd style passwords are the future

this comic is super general, and a bit exaggerated, but the logic is sound. it conveys the general idea.
